Modify Order

User would be able to modify some attributes of an order as long as it is with open/pending status in system. For modification order identifier is mandatory. With order identifier you need to send the optional parameter(s) which needs to be modified. In case the optional parameters aren't sent, the default will be considered from the original order.

Place Order

This API allows you to place an equity/derivative order to the exchange i.e the place order request typically registers the order with OMS and when it happens successfully, a success response is returned. Successful placement of an order via the API does not imply its successful execution. To be precise, under normal scenarios, the whole flow of order execution starting with order placement, routing to OMS and transfer to the exchange, order execution, and confirmation from exchange happen real time. But due to various reasons like market hours, exchange related checks etc. This may not happen instantly. So when an order is successfully placed the placeOrder API returns an orderNumber in response, and in scenarios as above the actual order status can be checked separately using the orderStatus API call.This is for Placing CNC, MIS and NRML Orders 

### Example
```javascript
var StockNoteApiDocumentation = require('stock_note_api_documentation');

var apiInstance = new StockNoteApiDocumentation.OrdersApi();

var xSessionToken = "xSessionToken_example"; // String | Session token that should be used with API request is given in the response. It is used as an authenticator.

var opts = { 
  'body': new StockNoteApiDocumentation.OrderRequest() // OrderRequest | 
};

var callback = function(error, data, response) {
  if (error) {
